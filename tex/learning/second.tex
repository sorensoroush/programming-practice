Test document

Words \footnote{and I have a footnote!}

Some more words to end this second document

\footnote{Testing a footnote without any text}

That should be it\footnote{Testing without a space between the text}

One more line: testing the footnote snippet \footnote{It works!}\footnote{Footnotes for footnotes?} 

Testing this character:~Does something change? (This line had no space)

Testing the tilde with space this time:

~

Same paragraph? Or different?
